## My Approach to this assignment

I started this assignment with the Blog Section. I wanted to implement a Code Editor on the left side and a markdown preview component on the right side. I wanted to use CodeMirror for the code editor but I got stuck in getting Next.js to work with MDX, I have not made any blog websites previously so this was my first attempt at it. I just implemented a basic textarea for the content of the blog, I had no time left for implementing the image upload for both blog and products section, I wanted to implement the image upload with Cloudinary, but couldn't do it on time. So, I have just implemented a basic blogs and products listing page, admin dashboard without Login functionality, I just had some difficulty implementing MDX with Next.js which I figured out from Next.js starter template for blog and their documentation. Heartfelt apologies for not completing the assignment, but will be working on it to complete it. Also, I just got too stuck on making the UI look better.
